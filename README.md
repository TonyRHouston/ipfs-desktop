## Install

To install it from source you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>=10.4.0` and
need [npm](npmjs.org) `>=6.1.0` installed. This uses [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) so **you must take a look** at their [platform specific dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

Then the follow the steps below to clone the source code, install the dependencies and run it the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop.git
cd ipfs-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

The IPFS Desktop app will launch and should appear in your OS menu bar.

## Translations

The translations are stored on [./src/locales](./src/locales) and the English version is the source of truth.
Other languages are periodically pulled from [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/), a web interface to help us translate IPFS Desktop and its components to another languages.

## Releasing

- Bump the version in the package.json & run `npm install`
- Commit and push to master
- CI will build installers for macos, win & linux attach them to a new [Draft Release](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases)
- Iterate on changes till you are happy that the release is ready. CI will update the artefacts attached to the draft release as PRs are merged into master.
- Publish the release. Github will tag master at that point.
- The `latest.yml, latest-mac.yml, latest-linux.yml` files on the release are used by the app to determin when an app update is available. Once a release is published, users should recieve the app update. See: https://www.electron.build/auto-update
- To start work on the next version, bump the version in the package.json and repeat theses steps.

## FAQ

### Where is the configuration and logs?

The configuration file and logs are located on `~/Library/Application Support/IPFS Desktop` on macOS and `%appdata%/ipfs-desktop` on Windows. For quick access to this folders, just right-click on your tray icon and then 'Logs Directory' or 'Configuration File', depending on what you want.

### How do we select the IFPS repo location?

We use [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), which, in default conditions, will check `IPFS_PATH` environment variable. If not set, we fallback to `$HOME/.ipfs`. As soon as the first run has succeded, we save the information about the repository location in the configuration file, which becomes the source of truth.

### Which version of IPFS are we running?

Since we're using [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), we have our own embedded IPFS binary. We try to always have the latest version.

### Which flags do we use to boot IPFS?

By default we use the flags `--migrate=true --routing=dhtclient` when running the IPFS daemon. They can be changed via the configuration file, which can be easily accessed as mentioned above.
